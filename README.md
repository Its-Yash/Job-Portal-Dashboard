Objective
The purpose of developing an Online Job Search Portal comes from my idea to make the job search efficient and handy. It helps the recruiters as a primary source of talent search. It also helps the job seekers to search for current vacancies at a single point. Therefore, we can say that Online Job Search Portal act as a bridge of communication between organizations and applicants. With the evolution of technology and internet being the main source of information for the applicants, these job portals and have become an excellent method to reach wide range of audience. Initially, when I am unaware of these portals, I used to do research about companies and their technology stack through their respective websites and apply if the job responsibilities matches my interests. This requires lots of effort and time. However, later when I realized the importance of job search portals, I am able to access jobs in companies, locations that I might not otherwise have learned.

Introduction

The only way to select best-qualified candidate is to have a pool of eligible applicants, which is possible by drawing the interest of individuals in the market. Job search portals best serve this purpose. E-recruitment has become the standard means for employers and job seekers to meet their respective objectives.

Methodology

The Web Information Systems Development Methodology (WISDM) is an ISD methodology, developed by Richard Vidgen, David Avison, Bob Wood and Trevor Wood-Harper (Vidgen 2002). This method adapted the traditional system development methods, web development technology and the hypermedia development methodology.[2] Hypermedia is a mix of rich texts, graphics, audio and video, and uses hyperlink to link to other pages and sections of an application. The main framework of WISDM is extracted from Multitier. Multitier is a methodology with user participative approach that includes many stakeholders like developers who are responsible for developing the Job Portal and users who are using the Job Portal. Therefore, Multitier focuses on both the human and technical aspects of Information System. The framework of the WISDM that helps in the development of a Web-based Information Systems considers two aspects: one relating to the organizations, people and technology; the other relating to the analysis and design. The WISDM mainly focuses on Organizational analysis, Information analysis, Technical design, Human computer interaction and Work design.[5] There is no prior ordering of the five aspects of the said method. Each method has been emphasized alone during the project development. Multitier frame work methodology of WISDM.
